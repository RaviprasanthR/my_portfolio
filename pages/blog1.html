        <h1><strong>
            Your first step to become a blogger
        </strong></h1>
        
        <p>
            I know it all start with a first blog post. Right now I am in that situation.
            In this blog i will share my experience of writing my first blog.
            <h2>Confusion :</h2>
            What to write about? How to write? Will people read it? Can I become a good blogger?
            <br><br>
            If you have not come across these kind of confusion while writing your first blog, then you have not taken blogging seriouly.
            It is common to have all these confusions and fear. Only those who get beyond this confusion and fear would become a good blogger.
            First of all we have to believe in ourself. We should develope a "I can do it " attitude towards what we do.
